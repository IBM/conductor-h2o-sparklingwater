# H2O Sparkling Water integration with Conductor

### This is a fork of IBM Conductor for changes needed for Sparkling Water 3.32.0.5
Project to integrate H2O Sparkling Water as a notebook in IBM Spectrum Conductor.

### Using:
Download H2O Sparkling Water and place it in the package folder. In the scripts/common.inc file update the version from 3.32.0.5 to the version you are using if it is different. Then run the build_package.sh script to build the package.

Then you can add this package (example: H2O_Sparklingwater-3.32.0.5-1-2.3.tar.gz) to your Conductor cluster through the "Add" button on "Workload" / "Spark" / "Notebook Management" page.
Parameters you have to define:
- Name
- Version (typically the version of H2O Sparkling Water, example 3.32.0.5)
- Prestart command: ./scripts/prestart_nb.sh
- Start command: ./scripts/start_nb.sh
- Stop command: ./scripts/stop_nb.sh
- Job monitor command: ./scripts/jobMonitor.sh

Additional environment variables: H2O_SPARK_CONF = --conf spark.ext.h2o.nthreads=1 --conf spark.driver.memory=8g

Then you can add it to an existing Spark Instance Group (you need to stop it then go to the configuration page) or create a new Spark Instance Group with it.
 
In the Spark instance group configuration you need to set:
- SPARK_EGO_ENABLE_PREEMPTION=false
- SPARK_EGO_FREE_SLOTS_IDLE_TIMEOUT=3000
- SPARK_EGO_EXECUTOR_IDLE_TIMEOUT=3000
- SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY=8g
- JAVA_HOME to the location of Open JDK, example /usr

Optional:

SPARK_EGO_SLOTS_PER_TASK and SPARK_EGO_EXECUTOR_SLOTS_MAX can be both be set to 1, if you expect executors and slots to match. Otherwise an executor may take multiple slots.

When restricting the size of the H2O Sparkling Water cluster set spark.ego.slots.max and spark.ego.slots.required and spark.ext.h2o.cluster.size to the same number of slots you want the cluster to take.
